/**
 * BeanFactory接口的扩展，可以枚举全部的 Bean示例，而不是在客户端根据名称一个个的尝试查找。
 * <p>
 * BeanFactory实现类预加载 Bean definitions（例如：基于XML的工厂） 时可以实现本接口。
 * <p>
 * 这个接口中的方法只会考虑本factory定义的bean.会忽略{@code ConfigurableBeanFactory#registerSingleton}
 * 方法注册的单例bean。不过{@code getBeanNamesForType}和 {@code getBeansOfType}例外，它们一样会考虑手动注册的单例。
 * 当然{@code BeanFactory#getBean}一样可以透明访问这些特殊bean.
 * 然而在特殊情况下,所有的bean都是由external bean定义,所以应用不需要顾虑这些差别.
 * <p>
 * 这个工厂接口扩展了BeanFactory的功能，作为上文指出的BeanFactory二级接口，有9个独有的方法，
 * 扩展了跟BeanDefinition的功能，提供了BeanDefinition、BeanName、注解有关的各种操作。
 * 它可以根据条件返回Bean的集合，这就是它名字的由来——ListableBeanFactory
 * <p>
 * （BeanFactory：Spring中的IOC容器；FactoryBean：利用BeanDefinition构建Bean的工厂。）
 * <p>
 * Extension of the {@link BeanFactory} interface to be implemented by bean factories
 * that can enumerate all their bean instances, rather than attempting bean lookup
 * by name one by one as requested by clients. BeanFactory implementations that
 * preload all their bean definitions (such as XML-based factories) may implement
 * this interface.
 *
 * <p>If this is a {@link HierarchicalBeanFactory}, the return values will <i>not</i>
 * take any BeanFactory hierarchy into account, but will relate only to the beans
 * defined in the current factory. Use the {@link BeanFactoryUtils} helper class
 * to consider beans in ancestor factories too.
 *
 * <p>The methods in this interface will just respect bean definitions of this factory.
 * They will ignore any singleton beans that have been registered by other means like
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory}'s
 * {@code registerSingleton} method, with the exception of
 * {@code getBeanNamesForType} and {@code getBeansOfType} which will check
 * such manually registered singletons too. Of course, BeanFactory's {@code getBean}
 * does allow transparent access to such special beans as well. However, in typical
 * scenarios, all beans will be defined by external bean definitions anyway, so most
 * applications don't need to worry about this differentiation.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> With the exception of {@code getBeanDefinitionCount}
 * and {@code containsBeanDefinition}, the methods in this interface
 * are not designed for frequent invocation. Implementations may be slow.
